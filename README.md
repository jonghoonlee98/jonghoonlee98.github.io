1)All aspects of this assignment seem to have been correctly implemented. All the html and css files pass the validation test online. The images are correctly uploaded and placed in the page. The only concern is the "#jonghoonlee98.github.io" that shows up at the bottom of every page.

2)I used Piazza to receive clarifications on certain parts of the assignment but have not collobarated with anyone individually

3)I spent about 2 hours total on this assignment# jonghoonlee98.github.io
