Biography:
</h3>
<p>
My name is Jong Hoon Lee. I was born in South Korea and moved to the United States at the age of 4. I lived in the small town of Leonia, New Jersey up until my senior year of high school. I would say during these years, I spent a lot of time playing video games with my friends. In the fall of 2016, I began my college career at Tufts University as a Questbridge scholar. As an intended computer science major, I hope to someday create a program with a group of people that will better the world we live in.
